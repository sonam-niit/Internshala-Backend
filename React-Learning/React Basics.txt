What is React?
---------------------------------
React is a JS Library using that we can create UI (User Interface)
You can create SPA (single page application and you can make reusable components.

Real Dom?
--------------------------
like a tree structure of HTML document.
When you maupulate the DOM the entire DOM is getting updated.
Updating the Real DOM is time-consuming when there is a large application because its re rendering the entie structure of APP
Whenever you directly manupulate DOM is slower and lead to performance issue.

Virtual DOM is importan feature of React
-------------------------------------------------
--its just a memory representation of Real DOM of the webpage created from.
-- when you make any changes it updates the virtual DOM then compare with Real Dom then update only the things which changed rather than updating the real DOM.
--Updating virtual DOM is more faster than Real DOM
--Chaages made to the Virtual DOM not in real DOM beacuse of that its more efficient.


How to Create React Application?

npx create-react-app appname

--> npx (npm execute) means rather than installing the create-react-app its just execute in the background and create react application.


Let's create 1 application

>npx create-react-app session1

Move to that created app
>cd session1

Open the Application in VS Code

>code .

Let's start application
>npm start

you can see the output at localhost:3000/

Project Structure

node_modules
----------------------
folder which is holding all the packages required for react application.
(this folder we can delete whenever its needed because we will get it back again by executing npm install command.)

.gitignore
--------------------
its for github which tells github to ignore certain files to upload on github

Readme file
-------------------
for github where you can provide information of your project to the users.

package.json file
----------------------------
config file for your application which is having all the dependencied used by your project.

package lock file is for the exact location from where the dependencies downloaded.

Public
----------------
index.html file which you can see in browser.
